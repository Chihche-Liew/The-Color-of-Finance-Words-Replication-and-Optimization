The contents of the code folder encompass a collection of scripts and utilities central to this research endeavor. To provide context, the following delineation elucidates the constituent elements:

# R Code Files from 0 to 3
`code_0`: Comprises my personal implementation designed for the meticulous construction of variables. This intricate procedure closely adheres to the meticulous data structure outlined by García et al.

`code_1` to `code_3`: These modules are extracted from the comprehensive dataset and code compilation presented by García et al: .https://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/garcia/data.html, which is hosted on their dedicated website here. The incorporation of these modules bolsters our analytical framework.

# R Code Files with '.1' Suffix
Supplementary to the primary code corpus, the repository also encompasses R code files denoted by a '.1' suffix. These files have been tailored to cater to novel conversation datasets, thereby extending the repository's applicability beyond its original scope.

# Text Preprocessing for Conversations
The `TextPreprocessingConversation` script occupies a pivotal role in the preprocessing pipeline. It orchestrates the transformation of raw textual data into an organized, structured format, facilitated through the creation of tidy dataframes. This preparatory phase is indispensable for subsequent stages of analysis.

# Fine-Tuning BERT 
The `FineTuneBert` is at the center of our current research push, we are trying to fine tune Google Bert to achieve more accurate text-based real-time earnings predictions
